## 🧾 mapp Recipe Framework

The following features and functionality are included in the **mapp Recipe Framework**:  

• The infrastructure to set up **two distinct recipe files**, with a structure variable registered to each  

• The ability to **save recipes to a USB drive**  

• The ability to **preview and edit a recipe** on the **HMI** before loading it  

• The recipe system is set up in the **XML format**. (To convert to a **CSV recipe system**, see here.)

   1. Both the **RecipeXML.mprecipexml** and **RecipeCSV.mprecipecsv** configuration files are already included in the Framework to enable the ability to easily switch back and forth. Only **one** of these configuration files is used at a time (i.e. the **MpLink** from only one of these files is referenced in the application).
