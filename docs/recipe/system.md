## 🧾 Recipe System Design

* There are two recipe categories in this recipe system: "Parameters" and "Machine Configuration".&nbsp;
* Each category gets saved to its own recipe file.&nbsp;
* One structure variable is registered to each category.&nbsp; 

    * Parameters\_type holds the product data.&nbsp;
    * MachineSettings\_type holds the machine data.&nbsp;

* Three variables of each datatype are used in order to accomplish the preview functionality and the ability to edit a recipe without formally loading it. For example, let's focus on the parameters structure: 

    * The variable Parameters is the actual variable structure that holds the active recipe, which should be used around the application. This variable is not directly registered to the recipe.&nbsp; 
    * The variable ParametersPreview is the only variable that is registered to the Product category of the recipe. This allows you to load and preview recipes without actually activating them in the application. If a recipe should be loaded to the application, then the Parameters variable structure gets set equal to the ParametersPreview structure by the Framework.&nbsp; 
    * The variable ParametersEdit is used as an intermediary structure to be able to edit the recipe without loading it to the application. It also acts as a buffer between the registered variable so that you can easily discard changes while editing if you need to.&nbsp;

  * The custom compound widgets used to display Active and Preview values also incorporate a value compare feature. 
The widget compares the selected recipe preview values with the active recipe values and if they differ, changes the background of the preview value. This background change is accomplished by changing the style of the standard widget using the modifiedStyle setting under Appearance of the compound widget.

ℹ️ **Note**

Note that the **Recipe Framework** contains some **While loops** in the **Initialization program**, whereas the other Frameworks do not.

The reason for this is that the Framework **loads the default recipes** in the Initialization program. As a result, the supporting **function blocks must be active** before the load command can be successfully triggered. 

The default recipes are loaded in the **Initialization program** rather than the **Cyclic program** to avoid the need for a **global variable across the Frameworks** to indicate when the recipes have finished loading.
