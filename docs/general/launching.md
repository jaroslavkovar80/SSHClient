## ℹ️ Launching the importer

>IMPORTANT:
>
>After installing the **mapp Framework 6**, close and re-open Automation Studio before you try to launch the importer. 

You **must** close the software configuration and CPU configuration before performing an import.

To launch the **mapp Framework 6** import tool within Automation Studio, first make sure to set a version for the Framework in Project -> Change Runtime Versions: 

![Visu import1][def]


Then navigate to Tools → **mapp Framework 6** Importer: 

![Visu import2][def2]

Notes: 

* If you don't see this menu option after installing the Framework, then please close and re-open Automation Studio. 
* If this menu option is grayed out, then the version number has not yet been set in Change Runtime Versions. 
* It is recommended to close all open tabs before launching the importer. 
* You can only import **mapp Framework 6** components to the active configuration.
