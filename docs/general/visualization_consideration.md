## Interface to the HMI

Each **mapp Framework 6** has a structure variable for **commands, parameters, and status information** from the HMI.

This variable name always starts with Hmi followed by the mapp Technology.  
Example: HmiRecipe

>Note:  
>The only exception is the Axis framework, where the HMI is linked directly to the AxisCommands structure.
>
>This is because:<br>
>  * in manual mode the commands come from the HMI<br>
>  * in automatic mode the commands are triggered directly in the application 
>
>To avoid creating an intermediate structure just for the sake of the HMI, the HMI interacts directly with AxisCommands.

Similarly, each **mapp Framework 6** has an action file called HMIActions.st, which contains all programming related to the HMI interface.

## mapp View Demo Page

A mapp View demo page is included in the **mapp Framework 6** so that you can quickly and easily navigate through all the imported contents in Chrome.

This page is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended to be used in the final application.

If you do not yet have a mapp View visualization when you import the Framework: 

* the Demo page is assigned as the start page

If you have an existing mapp View application that the Framework merges into:

* the Demo page is added to the pages list

* you must add navigation to this page yourself
