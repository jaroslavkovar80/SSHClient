## ℹ️ Community Driven Resource

The **mapp Framework 6** is a community driven and open source resource. Input from the community is used to continually refine and improve the **mapp Framework 6**. It is not an official product from B&R.

The GitHub repository that holds the Framework source project is available at:
[link](https://github.com/br-automation-community/mapp-Framework-6)

Application engineers can suggest modifications or new functionality directly via GitHub. In this way, the **mapp Framework 6** is constantly evolving and improving through community input.

The **mapp Framework 6** uses standard mapp components, and general questions about mapp should continue to be directed to local B&R support.

Because the Framework itself is community driven, questions related specifically to the **mapp Framework 6** should be asked in the B&R Community forum - [B&R Community - **mapp Framework 6**](https://community.br-automation.com/c/community-projects/mapp-framework/16)

This project is **not part of official B&R R&D development** and is **not covered by official B&R support**, maintenance contracts, or product roadmaps.
