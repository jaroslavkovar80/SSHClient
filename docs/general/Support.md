## Community Driven Resource

The mapp Framework is a community driven and open source resource. Input from the community is used to continually refine and improve the mapp Framework. It is not an official product from B&R.

The GitHub repository that holds the Framework source project is available at:
[link](https://github.com/br-automation-community/mapp-Framework)

Application engineers can suggest modifications or new functionality directly via GitHub. In this way, the mapp Framework is constantly evolving and improving through community input.

The mapp Framework uses standard mapp components, and general questions about mapp should continue to be directed to local B&R support.

Because the Framework itself is community driven, questions related specifically to the mapp Framework should be asked in the B&R Community forum - [B&R Community - mapp Framework](https://community.br-automation.com/c/community-projects/mapp-framework/16)

This project is **not part of official B&R R&D development** and is **not covered by official B&R support**, maintenance contracts, or product roadmaps.
