**## Overview**

mapp Technology is the overarching term for the ready-made, modular software products at B&R. This technology enables you to implement complex or tedious features (such as a recipe system) with just a few mapp function blocks and configuration settings rather than creating it from scratch with PLCopen.

By using mapp Technology you can complete your application development up to three times faster, with significantly less code than if you wrote it entirely with PLCopen.

The mapp Framework takes mapp Technology one step further to provide the user with a universal starting point for mapp Technology. This even further reduces the amount of application code that must be written by the application engineer.

The Framework includes programming tasks and supporting configuration files with built-in best practices and application know-how. It is designed to be modular, so the user can easily add the specific parts that are relevant to the machine to an existing project.

**## Motivation and Goals**

The overall goal of the mapp Framework is to streamline and simplify your mapp Services and Axis implementation.

More specifically, the goals are:

**### Quality**
- The Framework is designed with best practices in mind, which have been vetted by several experienced application engineers
- The goal is to set each mapp user up for success

**### Time Savings**
- By giving users a reliable starting point, the learning curve of mapp Technology is reduced
- New engineers can ramp up faster
- Quicker time to market

**### Simplicity**
- The mapp Framework is modular without being overly complex
- With a standardized approach to mapp Technology, application support, hand-off, and code maintenance become more straightforward
- The framework is scalable according to the needs of the application

**### Cost Savings**
- Use of the Framework results in cost savings for the machine due to reduced application engineering time

**## Community Driven Resource**

The mapp Framework is a community driven and open source resource. Input from the community is used to continually refine and improve the mapp Framework. It is not an official product from B&R.

The GitHub repository that holds the Framework source project is available at:
[link](https://github.com/br-automation-community/mapp-Framework)

Application engineers can suggest modifications or new functionality directly via GitHub. In this way, the mapp Framework is constantly evolving and improving through community input.

The mapp Framework uses standard mapp components, and general questions about mapp should continue to be directed to first level or second level support.

Because the Framework itself is community driven, questions related specifically to the mapp Framework should be asked in the B&R Community forum - [link](https://community.br-automation.com/c/community-projects/mapp-framework/16). Use the tag "mapp-framework" to ask a question or report a bug.

**## YouTube Tutorial Videos**

Short tutorial videos for each component of the mapp Framework are available in a dedicated playlist on the B&R YouTube channel - [link](https://www.youtube.com/c/brautomation).

These tutorial videos supplement the written documentation.

**## Availability**

A mapp Framework is currently available for the following mapp Technologies:

- mapp AlarmX
- mapp Audit
- mapp Axis
- mapp Backup
- mapp File
- mapp PackML
- mapp Recipe
- mapp Report
- mapp UserX

A corresponding HMI is available in mapp View and VC4.

**## Framework Contents**

Each mapp Framework contains the following:

- Logical View task(s)
- Configuration file(s)
- Help files

The supporting Help pages are individualized for each mapp Framework. These pages identify what is included in the framework and any changes that are necessary to properly embed the framework into an existing application.

The documentation focuses on the Framework itself and not on the fundamentals of mapp Services or mapp Motion.

For details on the fundamentals of mapp Technology, refer to the respective Help sections:
- Services → mapp Services
- Motion control → mapp Motion

> IMPORTANT:  
> Every mapp Framework Help section contains a page titled "Required Modifications".  
> The steps on this page must be executed to bring the Framework into a functional state.
