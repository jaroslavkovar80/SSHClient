# Default User Partition Files

The Framework contains a few default files (e.g. recipe files) that need to be transferred to the user partition via an offline install or FTP access. These files are located in the Logical View within the "UserPartition" package.

(If the user changed the mapp Framework file devices to correspond to a location other than the user partition, then these files need to be placed in that new location instead.)
