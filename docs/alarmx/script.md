## AlarmX Configuration Import and Export via Python

A Python script is provided within the AlarmX package in the Logical View.

This script allows you to export the AlarmX configuration to Excel and then re-import the AlarmX configuration back into the project after you've made any necessary changes.

2. Change directory to:

```
  ..directory of project..\Logical\Infrastructure\AlarmX
```

3. Edit the following command according to your configuration name and PLC name, and then run it in the command line:
```
   - python AlarmImportExport.py --export True --csv-file .\Alarmx.csv --mpalarmxcore "..\..\..\Physical\{ConfigName}\{PLCname}\mappServices\AlarmX\AlarmXCfg.mpalarmxcore"
```
   > Note:  
   > During Python installation, if you associated .py files with the Python executable, then remove the word "python" 
   > from the beginning of the command.

4. Open the resulting AlarmX.csv file in Excel.
