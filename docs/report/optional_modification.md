## ⚙️ Optional Modifications

The Framework can be adjusted as needed for the application in any way necessary.

This section summarizes some **optional modifications** that are commonly done to the Framework.

* In the **CPU configuration**, modify the **mappReportFiles** file device to the desired storage medium. By default, this corresponds to the **User partition** (**F:\Report**).<br>
    - If you do, modify or delete lines **10–16** of the **ReportMgr.st INIT** program, which creates the directory **F:\Report** if it does not already exist.
