| **AxisStateMachine.st** | Action | **Referenced file within the AxisTemplate package** | Generic **state machine** used for all axes.<br>Includes states such as power-on, homing, manual/automatic operation, stopping, etc. |
| **SimulationControl.st** | Action | **Unique / dedicated file per axis** | Supporting code for **simulation**.<br>Modify as needed for simulation requirements. |
| **AxisControlModes.st** | Action | **Unique / dedicated file per axis** | Axis-specific programming.<br>Contains **manual and automatic mode state machines**.<br>Manual mode is set up for basic jogging.<br>Automatic mode is empty by default and intended to be filled per application. |
| **Recipe.st** | Action | **Referenced file within the AxisTemplate package** | Registers axis variables to the **recipe system**.<br>Optionally add additional variables as needed. |
