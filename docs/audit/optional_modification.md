## ⚙️ Optional Modifications

The Framework can be adjusted as needed for the application in any way necessary.  
This section summarizes some optional modifications that are commonly done to the Framework. 

• **Implement custom audit events** throughout the application as needed for debugging during development.  
  These audit events correspond to the **custom event audit trail**.  
  The full process is as follows:  

  1. Increase the value of **MAX_CUSTOM_EVENTS** within **AuditMgr.var** according to how many custom events you will use.  

  2. Define the text for the **type**, **message**, and **comment** of each custom audit event in the **CustomEvent** variable structure.  
     This is done in the initialization program of **AuditMgr.st** starting on line **35**.  
     Alternatively, you can do this directly in the **"Value"** column of **AuditMgr.var**.  
     These texts will be used when calling the **MpAuditCustomEvent()** function block.  
     Note that you can only provide the texts in **one language** (they are **not localizable**).  

  3. Trigger the custom events throughout the application.  
     Examples for how to do this are shown starting on line **75** of **AuditMgr.st**.  

• The **localizable text files** for **mapp Services audit events** are provided in the  
  **Infrastructure/Audit** package of the **Logical View**.  
  These files were originally taken from the **MpAudit** library, but they were expanded upon for the Framework.  
  Edit the text entries as needed.  

• In the **CPU configuration**, modify the **mappAuditFiles** file device to the desired storage medium.  
  By default, this corresponds to the **User partition** (**F:\Audit**).  

  o If you do, modify or delete lines **10–16** of the **AuditMgr.st INIT** program,  
    which creates the directory **F:\Audit** if it does not already exist.
