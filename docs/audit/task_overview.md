### ⚙️ Localizable Alarm Texts

A **localizable text file** for the **mapp Audit alarms** is included within the **Audit package**

These alarm texts are referenced in the **mapp Audit configuration** instead of the default alarm texts provided by **mapp Services**, which makes it easier to expand the texts to include the **language of your choice**.
