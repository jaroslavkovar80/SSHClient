## 🛡️ mapp Audit Framework Features

The following features and functionality are included in the **mapp Audit Framework**:  

* **Two audit systems**:  

    1. mapp Services events  
       This audit trail captures all built-in events related to the other **mapp Services frameworks** that are included in the project  

    2. Custom events  
       This audit trail can be used for **debugging and troubleshooting** the application. The intention with these custom events is that you can leave **"breadcrumbs"** throughout the application which can help you track down bugs in the application code.  For example, if you are troubleshooting a page fault, you could trigger a custom audit event at the top of every task or in several places throughout a task to narrow down where the page fault occurs.  
       The text for the custom audit event is provided directly to the **MpAuditCustomEvent()** function.   For more details, see here.  

* **mapp View content** to view the audit list  

    o The audit systems use **separate display texts**, meaning the text shown on the **HMI** is different from the text that gets exported to the file.   This allows you to show a succinct message in the message column on the HMI, and optionally add information in the timestamp column, user column, etc.  The exported audit file then contains more information directly in the message.  

* The ability to **export an audit archive** and choose your **export format** via the **HMI**  
* The ability to **configure automatic archiving**  

* The **text system** has been set up to generate applicable text for all **mapp Services audit events**  

* A **query** along with the supporting **state machine** to be able to query large amounts of data

### 🧾 Variable Monitoring Audit Example

An example of setting up a **variable monitoring audit event** is provided within the Framework:  

* You can choose to record the **value change events** of specific variables by adding them to the **"Variable Monitor"** list in the **mapp Audit Configuration**  

    * The provided example uses variable **::AuditMgr:VariableMonitorExample**  

* The **localizable text definition** for these events is defined in the **TxtDatapoints.tmx** files  

    * Namespace **MpAudit/DP** for the exported text, and namespace **MpAudit/Display/DP** for the displayed text  

    * The **text ID** must be equal to the fully resolved variable name (**::AuditMgr:VariableMonitorExample** in this case)

### 🔐 Access Rights

The ability to **configure the automatic archive export** is restricted to the **Administrators** role.  

The ability to **create an immediate export** is restricted to the **Administrators** or **Service** role.  

The default administrative user is **Admin** with default password **123ABc**.  
The password **must be changed after import**.
