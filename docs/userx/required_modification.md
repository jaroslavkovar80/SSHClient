## 🔧 Required Modifications

The Framework by default provides a solid foundation, but in order to integrate it fully
into your application there are a few modifications that must be made.
The following list of modifications are required to get the Framework in a functional state
within the application.

1. Change the passwords for the **User**, **Admin**, **Operator**, **Service_Tech**, and **SystemUser**
users. This is done in the **User.user** file in the Configuration View  
(**AccessAndSecurity → UserRoleSystem → User.user**).  
Change the password for the **SystemUser** in code as well  
(**Infrastructure → UserX → UserXMgr → UserXMgr.var**).  
Note that if you already had users
in your project with these same names prior to import, your existing users will remain unchanged
and you do not need to update the passwords.

2. In the setting of the startup user, choose a user with no administrator rights. 
This is done in the **Config.mappviewcfg** file in the Configuration View
(**mappView → Config.mappviewcfg**).  
Then remove or modify the **AdminDefault** user accordingly.

3. If you imported the **mapp View front end** with the Framework, assign the **mapp View content**
(content ID = **UserX_content**) to an area on a page within your visualization.

4. If you did **not** import the mapp View front end, connect the **HmiUserX** structure elements
to your visualization accordingly.
