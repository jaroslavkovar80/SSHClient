## 🧩 Adding Additional PackML Modules

By default, the Framework has set up a **single main module** running in **synchronized mode**.

The user may choose to add additional **PackML child modules** by:
* Configuring a child module with parent **gPackMLModule_Main**
* Using the **StateMachine_Main** action file as a template to create a child state machine
* Using the **MpPackMLModule_Main** variable in **PackMLMgr** as a template for calling additional modules

See **Creating a hierarchy** to learn more about hierarchies and configuring child modules.
