## Alarm Reactions

The Framework establishes three alarm reactions by default within the alarm mapping.

1. Info (severity 1–9)
2. Warning (severity 10–19)
3. Error (severity 20–29)

![alarm1][def]

The **MpAlarmXCheckReaction()** function is called for each reaction within the **AlarmMgr** task.

![alarm2][def2]
---

## Optional Changes

The following optional changes should be considered to align the Framework with the application requirements.

* Adjust the severity ranges
  - This is done in the AlarmXCfg.mpalarmxcore configuration file

* Rename the reactions
  - This is done in the AlarmXCfg.mpalarmxcore configuration file
  - If you do this, remember to change the name in the **MpAlarmXCheckReaction()** function calls in **AlarmMgr.st** to the new name, starting at line 68
  - Examples of alternative reaction names:
    - SlowDownConveyor
    - HydraulicMotorOff
    - StopAllMotion
    - YellowLamp

* Add or remove reactions
  - This is done in the AlarmXCfg.mpalarmxcore configuration file
  - If you do this, remember to add or remove function calls of **MpAlarmXCheckReaction()** in **AlarmMgr.st** accordingly, starting at line 68

* Check for the reactions elsewhere in code
  - Typically, the **MpAlarmXCheckReaction()** function is called from other tasks within the application
  - For example, the axis control task might check for the Error reaction to determine whether to send a stop command to the axes. Copy and paste the IF statements containing  **MpAlarmXCheckReaction()** from **AlarmMgr.st** as needed throughout the application
