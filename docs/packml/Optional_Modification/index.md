## ⚙️ Optional Modifications

The Framework can be adjusted as needed for the application in any way necessary.

This section summarizes some **optional modifications** that are commonly done to the Framework.

- In the **CPU configuration**, modify the **mappPackMLFiles** file device to the desired storage medium.  
  By default, this corresponds to the **User partition** (**F:\PackML**).
  - If you do, modify or delete lines **10–16** of the **PackML.st INIT** program, which creates the directory **F:\PackML** if it does not already exist.
